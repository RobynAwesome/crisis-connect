## 🚀 **What Is CrisisConnect?**

CrisisConnect is not a standard responsive web app. It is an **Adaptive PWA** that transforms its behavior across **6 independent dimensions** under pressure, poor connectivity, and life-or-death conditions.

> *"Can this system still help the right person make the right decision under bad conditions?"*

Built under the **KPGS (Kopano-Phu Governance Systems)** framework and governed by the **THARI H.O.L.O Net** — Humanity-first Orchestrated Living Oversight.

---

## 🌐 **6 Dimensions of Adaptation (APWA Standard)**

| # | Dimension | What It Does |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Connectivity** | Online live → degraded text-first → offline field mode → sync-on-return |
| 2 | **Role** | Citizen reporter · Dispatcher triage · Field responder · Command layer |
| 3 | **Urgency** | Normal dashboards → one-tap incident → mass-incident surge workflows |
| 4 | **Device** | R800 Android phones · Desktop ops · Vehicle tablets · Public kiosk |
| 5 | **Trust** | Verified vs unverified sources · Confidence scoring · Stale-data warnings |
| 6 | **Local Context** | Region · Language · Hazard type · Protocol set · Network cost awareness |

---

## ⚡ **Core Features**

### 📡 **Offline-First Architecture**
* **Service Worker** with intelligent cache strategy — works during load-shedding
* **Local-first writes** — all actions queue locally and sync when connectivity returns
* **Background sync** with retry policy and conflict resolution
* **App-shell architecture** — instant load even on 2G connections

### 🚨 **Crisis Response Modes**
* **Normal Mode:** Full dashboards, analytics, and coordination tools
* **Incident Mode:** One-tap reporting, compressed UI, large touch targets
* **Mass-Incident Surge:** Auto-prioritization, bandwidth compression, text-only critical flows

### 🛡️ **Role-Based Interface**
* **Citizen Reporter:** Simple incident submission, location sharing, photo evidence
* **Dispatcher:** Triage queue, resource allocation, multi-incident overview
* **Field Responder:** Offline maps, checklist protocols, voice-note capture
* **Command Layer:** Strategic overview, resource dashboards, escalation controls

### ♿ **Human Factors Under Stress**
* Stress-mode UI with large targets and fewer choices
* High-contrast emergency states for outdoor visibility
* Text-first critical flows (no images required for core function)
* Accessibility-compliant — WCAG standards observed
* Localization-ready for South African languages

## 🎯 **Why CrisisConnect?**

South Africa faces:
- **Load-shedding** — apps that require constant connectivity fail
- **32.8% unemployment** — communities need tools they can run without data budgets
- **Township infrastructure gaps** — crisis response cannot depend on fiber

CrisisConnect is built for this reality. It works when the power is off, when data is expensive, when the phone costs R800, and when someone's house is flooding at 2AM.
